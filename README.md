Updating the package:

When you make changes, you can update the package using npm version <update_type>, where update_type is one of the semantic versioning release types, patch, minor, or major. This command will change the version number in package.json. Note that this will also add a tag with this release number to your git repository if you have one.

After updating the version number, you can npm publish again.
